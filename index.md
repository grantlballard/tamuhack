This example is just meant to get you started and show you a little of what's
possible with GitHub Pages. In just 3 simple steps, you will have your own
website.

1. [Link to the best school on earth :)](https://www.tamu.edu/)


{% highlight yaml %}
title: Hack on GitHub Pages
description: >
  This site will get you started hacking with GitHub Pages.
baseurl: "/tamuhack" # the subpath of your site
url: "https://grantlballard.github.io"
email: runner123g@tamu.edu
github_username:  grantlballard
twitter_username: @grantballard
{% endhighlight %}

That's it! You should now have a website of your own.

https://`your github username`.github.io/tamuhack

There's so much more you can do with GitHub Pages, so don't stop here.
Explore the code in this project and start making it your own.
Continue on to the [Resources]({{ "/resources" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
section to learn more about GitHub Pages and other handy tools.

If you have questions, please look for me at the hackathon. I am here to help!
