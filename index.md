1. [Link to the best school on earth :)](https://www.tamu.edu/)

Howdy, my name is Grant Ballard and I am a sophomore Electrical Engineering Student at Texas A&M University.
Although I am a EE student I still enjoy a lot of the software side of computing and have decided to 
pursue a Computer Science Minor.

This is my basic webpage and as I do more and more projects this should be updated.

Thanks for visiting!

If you have any questions or comments on anything I do feel free to contact me at:
